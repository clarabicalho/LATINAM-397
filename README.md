# LATINAM-397
Repository for R workshop for Stanford LATINAM 397 students (Winter 2026).

# Installing R and RStudio

1.  Download and install R [here](https://cran.wustl.edu). R is a programming language, like python, html, etc.

2.  Download and install RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). RStudio is what is called a GUI (graphical user interface) for R. It is a software that allows you to write and run R code and other file formats in a more user-friendly way. You can also use other GUIs for R (e.g., VSCode, Sublime, or even your own terminal), but RStudio is the most popular one.

For more details, see [Grolemund's "Hands On Programming with R."](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html#how-to-download-and-install-r).

# Helpful resources

Because of the pace of this workshop, we will not be going over the basics of the R programming language in as much detail as it deserves.

Whether you are a complete beginner of R or just need a refresher, there are plenty of open-source materials you can draw on. Here are a few:

- [Learning and Using R at Stanford](https://guides.library.stanford.edu/r/tutorials)

-   Garrett Grolemund's [*Hands-On Programming with R*](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/index.html) offers more details on R basics with exercises.

-   Hadley Wikham's [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) book for an overview of foundations as well as more advanced programming in R.

# Running into error messages is normal!

No matter your expertise in R or Rmd, you are bound to come upon issues when running your code or trying to compile your Rmd file. A few tips on how to approach errors:

1)  *Google your error message*. Most of the time, StackOverflow and RStudio Community will have answers for your kind of issue. Tip: Try understanding what your error message is saying and paraphrase the key issue in a general form (i.e., replace "variable" for any specific variable names, "directory" for your actual file path, etc)

2)  If the error is about a specific R function, read that function's documentation, by typing, for example `?mean` onto the console. You can also see example applications of that function in the documentation ("Help" pane).

3)  AI tools can also be effective ways to correct code and point out where errors are coming from. Use them cautiously (they can also write code that doesn't work).

4)  Review [Common R Programming Errors Faced by Beginners](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/06/common-r-programming-errors-faced-by-beginners/). It offers a list of key errors that most of us encounter when coding in R for the first time (or still do!).

5)  A few more helpful resources for debugging R code:
